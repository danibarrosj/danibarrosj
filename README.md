Hello! I'm Daniel J. Barros, a dedicated professional with a strong background in computer science, business administration, and IT support. My journey started in the United States Marine Corps, where I developed leadership, operational management, and technical troubleshooting skills. Now, I’m expanding my expertise in software development, cybersecurity, and system administration as I pursue my Master’s in Computer Science & Information Technology.

I started my programming journey in January 2025, and I am currently learning Python, C++, and SQL in school. Additionally, I am incorporating self-learning in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to expand my web development skills.
